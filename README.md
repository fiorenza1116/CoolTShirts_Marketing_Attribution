# ***CoolTShirts Marketing Attribution***



### ***Description***

CoolTShirts sells shirts of all kinds, as long as they are T-shaped and cool. Recently, CTS started a few marketing campaigns to increase website visits and purchases. Using touch attribution, they’d like to map their customers’ journey: from initial visit to purchase. They can use that information to optimize their marketing campaigns.

### ***Objective***

With the raw data provided, help CTS learn more about their campaigns. Write SQL queries to provide the answers to each question asked and visualize the solutions accordingly.


### ***Instructions For Viewers***

Review the [page_visits.csv](https://github.com/fiorenza1116/CoolTShirts_Marketing_Attribution/blob/main/page_visits.csv) data set below to get an understanding of the data behind the project. Then continue to the dashboard to review the visual solutions that were powered by the SQL queries [(CoolTShirt_Marketing_Attribution.sql)](https://github.com/fiorenza1116/CoolTShirts_Marketing_Attribution/blob/main/CoolTShirts_Marketing_Attribution.sql ) that I created.
